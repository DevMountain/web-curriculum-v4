<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>User Experience is how a person feels while interacting with a product or interface. The goal is to help users interact with a product that is useful and easy to use resulting in a positive and meaningful experience.</p>
<p>Everything is designed, whether it's done well or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>"In large part, what makes something usable is the absence of frustration in using it." - Dana Chisnell</p>
<p>When designing websites, we should strive to make them very easy to use. We want users to be able to do what they want in the way that they expect to be able to do it -- no roadblocks or questions.</p>
<p>When you're creating a feature, ask yourself if someone else would be able to use the feature easily without explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>UX Misconceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's the same thing as user interface design</li>
<ul>
<li>User experience design refers to any designed experience, this could be something like the way a store is set up or the smells and music at Disneyland. User interfaces just refer to digital interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's just a step in the process</li>
<ul>
<li>It's not just one part, it's woven throughout.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's only about technology</li>
<ul>
<li>Everything is designed and has an experience. We see UX through the lens of technology since we're developers, but it's about more than that - even with a website. When we design, we're not only thinking about what the users are seeing but what they'll be thinking and feeling about while they interact with the site.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's only about usability</li>
<ul>
<li>UX is about the whole experience, which includes how usable something is.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's only about the user</li>
<ul>
<li>The needs of the business also need to be taken into consideration. There's a balance between what's best for the user and the business.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's expensive</li>
<ul>
<li>It can be, but doesn't have to be.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's easy</li>
<ul>
<li>Designers make things seem easy because they make things make sense.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's the role of one person/department</li>
<ul>
<li>While there might be individual designers or a team of them, they work with other teams to help them implement design into what they're working on.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's a single discipline</li>
<ul>
<li>UX Design is relatively young and can encompass lots of different types of design depending on the business.</li>
</ul>
<li>It's a choice</li>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The biggest misconception is that [companies] have a choice to invest in their user's experience. To survive, they don't.&rdquo; - Josh Porter</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Interaction Design</h3>
<p>Let's talk about 5 core principles of interaction design.</p>
<h4>Consistent</h4>
<p>Good designs are consistent. We want users to be comfortable using our websites and consistency helps with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Visible</h4>
<p>Good designs are visible -- users need to be able to see what they can do in an app. They should be able to infer that an opportunity for interaction exists, don't make them guess/search for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Learnable</h4>
<p>Good designs are learnable. Users should be able to quickly pick up and use features.</p>
<p>Mental models can help users learn how to use a website. Making tabs look like real folder tabs or using switches can help. There are lots of these models that we can use to make interacting with our websites even better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Predictable</h4>
<p>Good designs are predictable. These principles are intertwined with each other. The more consistent a design, the more predictable it is, which then makes it easier to to learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>Good designs provide feedback. Have you ever been on a website, clicked on a button, and expected something to happen but nothing did? Then you don't know if you should click the same thing again or wait for it to load. But if there had been some feedback, like an error message, then you would know what you should have done next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Visual Design</h3>
<p>Visual design is all about what our websites look like -- what our users are actually seeing on the screen. We are going to talk about 4 principles of visual design: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Contrast</h4>
<p>We can have contrast in lots of different ways on our websites. We often think of color and making sure that we don't put a light yellow font on a white background. In addition to color, we can add contrast by using different sizes, shapes, types, and other elements. Contrast creates more interest in a design and can be used to organize information/establish hierarchy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Repetition</h4>
<p>Repetition is the conscious decision to repeat some element throughout the entire design. It helps to clarify and unify the design -- makes things look like they belong together. Repetition doesn't have to be the exact same thing repeated, you can also think about repeating colors or line weights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Alignment</h4>
<p>Every element in a design should have a visual connection to something else in the design. Avoid using more than one text alignment in the same design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Proximity</h4>
<p>Proximity is how close or far apart things are from one another. When items are placed close together, it implies that there's an association between them; conversely, if things are far apart it will be assumed that they're unrelated. This is why patterns like navigation bars exist -- put all the links close together so that they're easy to find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Grids and Spacing</h3>
<p>Grids and spacing bring together parts of both alignment and proximity. Grids bring order to the information and content presented and provide visual anchors to elements in the design. The columns are generally what's used to align the main parts of a design (like main content and side navigation). They're what make up the proportions of the website.</p>
<p>In a grid, we call the negative space around columns gutters. The gutters should always remain the same size even if the size of the columns changes. That negative space is also sometimes called whitespace. Whitespace is very important in design because it helps things from becoming too cluttered. It also helps differentiate between sections of the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Color Harmony</h3>
<p>Color harmony is when the arrangement of colors used are pleasing to the eye. Color harmony delivers a sense of balance and order. If colors are out of harmony, the design can become too bland or too obnoxious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>Typography helps with visual hierarchy. It also provides visual interest and helps make a website look more intentional than if you use the defaults.</p>
<p>Sans-serif and serif fonts are best for web design (sometimes monospace) because they are the most accessible. It's usually a good idea to stay away from overusing cursive or fantasy fonts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Go Big</h3>
<p>This is a simple rule that tends to override other rules, guides and principles. It is what it sounds like: make something big to draw attention to it. Readers notice and read big things first.</p>
